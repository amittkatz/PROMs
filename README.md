# PROMs

## Introduction
Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) address the current lack of understanding regarding the impact of diseases and treatments on patients' daily lives. 
These tools, developed in the last decade, enable patients to directly report outcomes, including symptom status, physical and mental health, social functioning, and overall well-being.

## Project goal
The research aims to characterize patients with low response rates to PROMs questionnaires and identify barriers based on the data that may contribute to the low response.
The research was conducted in collaboration with "Assuta Medical Center" and is based on their data from the years 2019-2021.
